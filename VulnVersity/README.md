# VulnVersity - TryHackMe

![alt text](https://github.com/DarioBeneventi/TryHackMe_Machines/blob/main/VulnVersity/images/vulnversity_header.png?raw=true)

This box contains a webserver that is vulnerable due to having a upload form page in one of its directories, we find the directoy in question by using GoBuster. We also fuzz out what extensions are allowed with the Burpsuite snipe attack to be able to know what format our backdoor has to be. To escalate our privileges we look for a misconfiguration in the SUID files, systemctl in particular is vulnerable and therefore we create a system d unit file that creates a backdoor to our attack machine but this time with the privileges of the root user.


 ### Tools Used
 * Nmap
 * Gobuster
 * Burpsuite

 ### Vulnerabilities
 * Vulnerable web server - upload form page
 * Misconfigured SUID

### Enumeration phase

* With our initial scan we can see that 6 ports are open and that on port 3333 a web server is running, we also know that our operating system is Ubuntu.

* We will be using gobuster to fuzz for directories & search for something interesting.

* Bingo we found a directory called internal, when we navigate to this page we can see a upload form page.

 ### Exploitation
 
* With the info we gathered in the enum part of our pentest we will now try to upload a payload to the webserver by using the upload form page located in the /internal/ directory.

* We get an error saying that the extension is not allowed.
* Luckily for us BurpSuite can help us determine what extensions are allowed by using it's snipe attack function in combination with a wordlist that contains payload extensions, make sure BurpSuite is configured to intercept all your browser traffic.
  1. First we go to Proxy - Intercept when we upload our file (shell in this case) once intercepted we right click the raw data and send it to the Intruder.
  2. In positions we wan't to specify what piece of text we wan't to fuzz, we do this by using the § character (see screenshot).
  3. In the Payload tab we load our wordlist of extensions we created and if needed remove the payload encoding (see screeenshot).
  4. Start the attack and look at the results tab to see what shell extension recieved a success response in the response sub-tab (see screeenshot).

* After our attack we now know that the .phtml extension can be uploaded to the webserver so we are going to use a PHP reverse shell as our payload. A reverse shell works by being called on the remote host and forcing this host to make a connection to you. So you'll listen for incoming connections, upload and have your shell executed which will beacon out to you to control! 
* We use the shell we found on [pentestmonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell) adjust it to our machine, upload it on the webserver and start a listener with netcat then we execute the shell by navigating to the uploaded shell.

* Now that we are inside we poke around and find our user which is called bill and his directory contains the user flag.

 ### Privilege Escalation

* Now that we have a initial foothold in the machine we would like to escalate our privileges and become the superuser. We will now do some more enumerating such as checking the config of SUID files.
* One file stands out which is called /bin/systemctl and looking at this [link](https://medium.com/@klockw3rk/privilege-escalation-leveraging-misconfigured-systemctl-permissions-bc62b0b28d49) we know why it is so important to have the rights to this file configured to superusers only.

* SUID (set owner userId upon execution) is a special type of file permission given to a file. SUID gives temporary permissions to a user to run the program/file with the permission of the file owner (rather than the user who runs it).
* Now that we know the systemctl has been misconifgured by using a SUID Bit we will be creating a systemd unit file which is where systemctl references when starting a service, this service will contain our backdoor.
* We first need to look for a writeable directory, we can use the var/tmp directory for this as an example.

* Now that our service is on the system we are going to use systemctl to start our backdoor service. Before starting the service we need to also run our netcat listener to capture the root shell.
